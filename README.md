# Energy-Consumption-Prediction
Predicts electricity demand using multiple models: Linear Regression, Random Forest (with optional GridSearchCV), Gradient Boosting, and an LSTM baseline for temporal patterns. Includes feature engineering, scaling, evaluation, and comparison.
This is an end-to-end electricity-demand predictor that benchmarks classic tabular models against an LSTM time-series model: it ingests an Excel/CSV dataset from data/ (set PATH to your file), parses a datetime column, sorts the data, engineers calendar features (year/month/day/hour) and optional lags/rolling stats, and splits chronologically into train/test. It then scales features (StandardScaler for tabular models, MinMaxScaler for LSTM targets), trains Linear Regression, Random Forest (optionally tuned via GridSearchCV), Gradient Boosting, and an LSTM configured with a configurable LOOK_BACK window, and reports MAE/MSE/RÂ² so you can compare approaches fairly. The script also plots predictions versus ground truth and, for tree models, exposes feature importances to explain which signals drive demand. Edit the param grid to trade off accuracy vs. runtime and tweak look-back, batch size, and epochs to stabilize the LSTM; core libs are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and tensorflow.
